# Lab04_TicTacToe

## Description

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns filling in the squares with their symbols, typically 'X' and 'O'. 
The objective is to create a winning pattern by placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. 
If all the squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw. 
This project implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game using C# on a console platform.
